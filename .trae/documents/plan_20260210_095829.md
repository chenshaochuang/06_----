Based on the analysis of the project structure and requirements, here is the implementation plan to allow viewing the total duration for the same task on the same day.

### 1. Localization Updates
Add new translation keys for the view toggle in `src/renderer/src/locales/zh.json` and `en.json`.
- **zh.json**: Add `"view_mode": "视图模式"`, `"group_by_task": "按任务分组"`, `"list_view": "列表视图"`
- **en.json**: Add `"view_mode": "View Mode"`, `"group_by_task": "Group by Task"`, `"list_view": "List View"`

### 2. Component Modification: `HistoryList.tsx`
Modify `src/renderer/src/components/HistoryList.tsx` to include:

1.  **State Management**: Add a state variable `viewMode` (or `isGrouped`) to switch between the standard chronological list and the aggregated task list.
2.  **Toggle UI**: Add a toggle button/icon in the header area (next to the "Total Time" display) to switch views.
3.  **Aggregation Logic**:
    -   Create a helper to group entries by `title`.
    -   Calculate the sum of durations for each unique title.
    -   Sort the grouped results by total duration (descending).
4.  **Render Logic**:
    -   When in "Grouped Mode", render a simplified list showing:
        -   Task Title
        -   Total Duration (formatted using existing `formatTime` helper)
        -   Count of sessions (optional but helpful, e.g., "3 records")

### 3. Verification
-   Start the application.
-   Create multiple time entries with the same title (e.g., "Coding").
-   Create entries with different titles.
-   Switch to "Group by Task" view.
-   Verify that the "Coding" entries are merged into one item with the correct total duration.
