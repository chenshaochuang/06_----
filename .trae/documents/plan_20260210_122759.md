I will comprehensively optimize the Floating Window UI to make it more modern, compact, and user-friendly.

### 1. Visual Overhaul (Glassmorphism & Modern aesthetic)
- **Container**: Change to a **rounded pill/card shape** with `backdrop-blur` and semi-transparent background for a modern "glass" effect.
- **Shadows & Borders**: Add subtle borders and shadows to ensure visibility against any desktop background.
- **Typography**: Optimize font sizes and weights for better readability in a small form factor.

### 2. State-Specific Improvements
- **Idle State**: 
  - Redesign the input field to be cleaner (pill-shaped input).
  - Add a prominent, glowing "Start" button.
- **Active State**: 
  - **Timer Focus**: Make the timer the central element with a monospace font for stability.
  - **Title Display**: Show the task title clearly but unobtrusively.
  - **Controls**: Refine the "Stop" and "Maximize" buttons to be accessible but not cluttering.
- **Stopping State**:
  - Improve the "Mood Selector" with better hover animations and layout.

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/components/FloatingWindow.tsx`
- **Logic**: 
  - Refactor the component structure for better layout management.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for all styling (animations, gradients, glass effects).
- **Window Size**: I may slightly adjust the window dimensions in `src/main/index.ts` if the new design requires a bit more breathing room (e.g., height 120px -> 130px), but will aim to keep it compact.

### 4. Verification
- I will verify the changes by running the app and checking the floating window in all three states (Idle, Active, Stopping).
