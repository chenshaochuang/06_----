I will implement the requested features by modifying `App.tsx`, `Timer.tsx`, and `HistoryList.tsx`.

### 1. Autocomplete for Event Input
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
  - Logic: Extract unique event titles from the `entries` list to create a list of suggestions.
  - Action: Pass these `suggestions` to the `Timer` component.
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/components/Timer.tsx`
  - Logic: Receive `suggestions` prop.
  - Action: Add a standard HTML `<datalist>` linked to the input field to provide native autocomplete functionality based on previous entries.

### 2. Timer for Ongoing Events
- **Analysis**: The existing `Timer.tsx` already contains a countdown/elapsed timer (`text-6xl`) that updates every second.
- **Action**: I will verify this functionality is preserved. No major changes needed here as the feature exists, but I will ensure the display is consistent.

### 3. Second-level Precision for Start/End Times
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/components/HistoryList.tsx`
  - Logic: The current time formatting only shows hours and minutes (`HH:mm`).
  - Action: Update `formatTimeRange` to include seconds (`HH:mm:ss`).
  - Action: Update the duration display (`formatTime`) to also include seconds for better precision (e.g., `1h 20m 30s`).
