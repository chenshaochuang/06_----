I will implement the "start without title, prompt on stop" feature by modifying `App.tsx` and `Timer.tsx`.

### 1. Update Business Logic (`src/renderer/src/App.tsx`)
*   **Modify `handleStop`**: Update the function signature to accept an optional `newTitle` parameter.
    *   If `newTitle` is provided, update the entry's title before saving.
    *   This ensures that the title collected at the end of the session is properly saved.

### 2. Update Timer Component (`src/renderer/src/components/Timer.tsx`)
*   **Allow Empty Start**: Remove the validation in `handleStart` that prevents starting the timer with an empty title.
*   **Add Late Title Input**:
    *   Add a new state `pendingTitle` to capture the title input during the stop phase.
    *   In the mood selection view (which appears after clicking Stop), check if `activeEntry.title` is empty.
    *   If empty, render an input field for the user to enter the task name.
    *   Disable the mood selection buttons if the title is still empty (forcing the user to input a title).
*   **Pass Title on Stop**: Update `handleMoodSelect` to pass the `pendingTitle` to the parent's `onStop` callback if it was captured.
*   **UI Polish**: Update the "Focusing on..." display to handle cases where the title is empty (e.g., show "Focusing..." instead of an empty string).

### 3. Verification
*   Start a timer without entering a title.
*   Verify the timer starts and shows a placeholder state.
*   Click Stop and verify the mood selection screen now includes a title input field.
*   Enter a title and select a mood.
*   Verify the entry is saved with the correct title, start time, end time, and mood.
